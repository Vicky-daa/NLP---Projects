# NLP and LLM Projects

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains my projects and understanding on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Model Learning (LLM).

## Overview

The field of Natural Language Processing is all about the interaction between humans and computers using natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human language in a valuable way.

Language Model Learning, on the other hand, is a crucial component of NLP. It involves training models on a large corpus of text and then using these models to predict the next word in a sentence or to generate entirely new sentences.

In this repository, you will find various projects that I have worked on in these areas.
